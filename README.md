# Group-Messenger-with-Total-and-FIFO-Ordering
Implementation of Total and FIFO Ordering With Failure Detection with B-multicast.
This project includes implemenation of ISIS algorithm for maintaining TOTAL order and with that we are using <br/>
Priority queues based on the sequences for any particular emulator/device to gurantee FIFO order.

This project is divided into two parts:<br/>
1). Without failure of any emulator/device<br/>
2). With failure of any random node <br/>
